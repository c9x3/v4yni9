# Welcome to the Hydrogen Project! 

What is the purpose of the Hydrogen Project? 

- Hydrogen is aimed at improving your experience by minimizing your distractions while working within your workflow. 

On the go and donâ€™t have an internet connection? 

- Hydrogen includes (optional) offline support meaning that you CAN continue working on your project(s) even without an internet connection! 

Short on storage? 

- Hydrogen stores your song data within a URL. This URL can be backed up within a simple text document so you can continue working on your project(s) without needing to worry about storage. 

Licensing info:

# Disclaimer: 

Hydrogen uses URLS as a means of storing song information. Browser extensions like ClearULRs may corrupt this song information thus, breaking Hydrogen. Reloading Hydrogen without the extension loaded/enabled should resolve this issue.
